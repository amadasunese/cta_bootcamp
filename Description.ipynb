    "<h2>Customer Churn Analysis</h2>\n",
    "<p>This project focuses on data cleaning and preprocessing, exploration and visualization. Using a dataset from a telecom company that includes customer information, such as demographics, usage patterns, and whether they churned (i.e., left the company) or not, the goal is to prepare the data for analysis, explore key patterns and trends, and create visualizations to gain insights into factors influencing customer churn.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "This was done with the following objectives in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "Clean and preprocess the raw dataset to make it suitable for analysis.\n",
    "Identify factors that may be associated with customer churn.\n",
    "Communicate findings through informative visualizations \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In doing this, the following steps were taken:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cleaning the Data to Prepare It for Analysis:\n",
    "Cleaning the data is a crucial step in the data analysis process. In doing this, it enables me to identify and address issues in the dataset to ensure its quality and reliability. Key tasks here include:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Handling missing values: Identifying and either imputing or removing data points with missing values\n",
    "b. Removing duplicates: Identifying and eliminating duplicate records to avoid skewing analysis.\n",
    "c. Outlier detection and treatment: Identifying and dealing with extreme values that can affect analysis.\n",
    "d. Standardizing data: Ensuring consistency in units and formats.\n",
    "e. Handling categorical data: Encoding categorical variables for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Explore the Data to Identify Key Variables and Statistics for the Various Customer Segments to get the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Descriptive statistics: Calculating summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for numeric variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Categorical summaries: Examining the distribution of categorical variables (e.g., counts and proportions).\n",
    "c. Identifying correlations: Determining relationships between variables using correlation coefficients.\n",
    "d. Segmenting the data: Dividing the dataset into meaningful segments or groups (e.g., by demographics or behavior).\n",
    "e. Hypothesis testing: Testing hypotheses or assumptions about the data to validate insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Using statistical tools, the data was visualize to tenerate insightful visualizations to communicate findings\n",
